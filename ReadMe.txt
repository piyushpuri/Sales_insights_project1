So very first thing here which comes in my mind after going through the all questions, that i have to target the regions of "United States" in map.

Overall it is clear in my mind that i need to show the performance over the time in year wise and quarterly, so for this i have created a two new columns in one column i have taken years only and another column i have taken "quater" only by using the queries.

Then i choose new slicer to display all this.

For taking Average Delivery days i give "DataDiff" query to take the difference between order date and ship date showing this in different new column, and for that column i choose in format "average" this will show me the average of delivery days in a "card".

Last but not the least i created a column chart in which i show the "Top 10 performing states by sales & Profit" in which i observe their is a states which have higher sales but profit is less as compared with the same with other states with lower sales but profit is same when we compare both where sales is more then we found that only a few states where sales is less but even they give good profits.

Visualisations 

1.) Slicer new
2.) Map
3.) Clustered column chart
4.) pie chart
5.) Doughnut chart
6.) Cards

Background :- For Background i have selected gradient wallpaper and give transparency to all charts and slicers and cards, and highlight all these, for slicers i enable borders and shadows, this give elegant look to overall dashboard.
